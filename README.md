# Library

A continuance of the Odin Project JS curriculum. This project is an interactive bookshelf for keeping track of all the books you have read and would like to read.

Some of the topics I included in this project are:
<p>Float and inline block methods</p>
<p>Dialog feature in HTML that allows for a pop-up modal</p>
<p>DOM manipulation methods to dynamically add book "cards"</p>
